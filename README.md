About Me! 

Hi, my name is Steven! I started my career as a carpenter framing new construction homes. While building homes you are given a blueprint of what the homeowner wants. From there I got to use my creative side to come up with a system to build the end result the homeowners were looking for. I chose to pivot and become a Software Engineer because I will get to use the same skills I used to build homes but with a keyboard instead of a hammer. I am looking forward to making an impact in the world by helping create meaningful software.
