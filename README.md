About Me! 

Hi, my name is Steven! Software Engineering has always interested me but I didn't have the means to go to school and learn traditionally, so I went into construction. I was a Foreman framing new construction homes but due to the nature of the work it started to take a toll on my body and I decided that it was time to make a switch. I am now attending a bootcamp called Actualize where I am learning the basics of coding and what it means to be a Software Engineer. I am looking forward to making an impact in the world by helping create meaningful software.
